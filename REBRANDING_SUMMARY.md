# Project Rebranding Summary

## Overview

**Date**: October 20, 2025
**Change**: Renamed from "spotify-dxt" to "spotify-mcpb"
**Reason**: Better reflect the MCPB bundle format and avoid confusion with the original spotify-dxt project

---

## Name Changes

### Previous Name
- **Repository URL**: `github.com/fabioc-aloha/spotify-dxt`
- **Project Name**: spotify-dxt (inherited from original macOS project)

### New Name
- **Repository URL**: `github.com/fabioc-aloha/spotify-mcpb`
- **Project Name**: Spotify MCPB
- **Bundle Name**: `spotify-mcpb-0.2.0.mcpb`

---

## Rationale

### Why "spotify-mcpb"?

1. **Clear Identity**: The name immediately identifies this as an MCPB bundle
2. **Format Alignment**: Aligns with the bundle file format (`.mcpb`)
3. **Differentiation**: Clearly distinguishes from the original spotify-dxt by Kenneth Lien
4. **Cross-Platform**: Better represents the cross-platform nature vs. macOS-only original
5. **Consistency**: Matches package name (`spotify-mcpb`) and manifest name

### Historical Context

- **Original Project**: [spotify-dxt](https://github.com/kenneth-lien/spotify-dxt) by Kenneth Lien
  - macOS-only using AppleScript
  - Direct Spotify app control
  - ~5 basic commands

- **This Project** (formerly also called spotify-dxt):
  - Complete rewrite using Spotify Web API
  - Cross-platform (Windows, macOS, Linux)
  - 16 comprehensive tools
  - MCPB bundle format for Claude Desktop
  - Now renamed to "spotify-mcpb" to avoid confusion

---

## Files Updated

- ✅ `manifest.json` - Repository, homepage, documentation, support URLs

### Documentation Files
- ✅ `README.md` - GitHub releases link
- ✅ `SETUP.md` - Issues link

## What Stayed the Same

### Preserved Original Credit
All documentation still credits the original project:
- References to [Kenneth Lien's spotify-dxt](https://github.com/kenneth-lien/spotify-dxt)
- Clear attribution as "Original Project"
- Acknowledgment of inspiration and foundation

### Technical Implementation
- No code changes required
- No API changes
- No breaking changes for users
- Same bundle structure
- Same tool names and functionality

---

## User Impact

### For New Users
- ✅ **Clearer Identity**: Immediately understand this is an MCPB bundle
- ✅ **Correct Repository**: All links point to spotify-mcpb repository
- ✅ **No Confusion**: Clear distinction from original macOS-only project

### For Existing Users
- ✅ **No Breaking Changes**: Bundle still works the same way
- ✅ **Same Functionality**: All 16 tools work identically
- ✅ **Same Configuration**: Same credentials and setup process
- ⚠️ **Update Bookmarks**: GitHub links now point to spotify-mcpb

### For Contributors
- ✅ **Correct Repository**: Clone from fabioc-aloha/spotify-mcpb
- ✅ **Updated Documentation**: All references point to new repo
- ✅ **Consistent Naming**: Project name matches bundle name
- ✅ **Directory Renamed**: Project folder renamed to `spotify-mcpb` to match project name

---

## Bundle Creation - Issue Resolved ✅

**The directory has been renamed to `spotify-mcpb`**, so the `mcpb pack` command now automatically creates correctly named bundles!

### Current Setup (After Directory Rename)

- **Directory name**: `spotify-mcpb` ✅
- **Manifest name**: `spotify-mcpb` ✅
- **Package name**: `spotify-mcpb` ✅
- **Result**: Running `mcpb pack` creates `spotify-mcpb.mcpb` ✅

### Recommended Commands

```bash
# Simple command - now works correctly!
mcpb pack

# Or specify version explicitly for versioned releases
mcpb pack . spotify-mcpb-0.2.1.mcpb
```

**Previous Issue (Now Resolved)**: The directory was originally named `spotify-dxt` which caused `mcpb pack` to create incorrectly named bundles. This has been fixed by renaming the directory to match the project name.

See [BUNDLE.md](BUNDLE.md) for more details.
