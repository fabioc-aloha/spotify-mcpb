### Title:
"Show HN: Spotify MCPB ‚Äì Control Spotify with Claude Desktop using MCP"

### Post:

Hi HN!

I built Spotify MCPB, an open-source tool that integrates Spotify with Claude Desktop using the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

What makes it interesting:

1. **Natural Language Control**: "Create a workout playlist with high-energy tracks" ‚Üí Claude does it
2. **Audio Analysis**: Get detailed audio features (energy, danceability, tempo, mood)
3. **Smart Recommendations**: AI-powered suggestions based on seed tracks/features
4. **Cross-Platform**: Windows, macOS, Linux (rewrote from macOS-only AppleScript)

Technical details:
- 16 MCP tools for comprehensive Spotify Web API coverage
- Interactive OAuth flow (no manual scripts needed)
- Efficient caching and batching for rate limiting
- MCPB bundle format for one-click deployment
- Node.js with ES6 modules, 0 vulnerabilities

It's based on spotify-dxt by Kenneth Lien but completely rewritten for cross-platform support using Spotify Web API instead of AppleScript.

MIT licensed, ~1700 files bundled, 3 MB download.

GitHub: https://github.com/fabioc-aloha/spotify-mcpb

Would love feedback on the architecture or feature suggestions!
